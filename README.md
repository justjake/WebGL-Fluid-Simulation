# WebGL Fluid Simulation (Typescript)

This repo is a fork of Pavel Dobryakov's WebGL fluid simulation.

My plan is:

1. Convert it to typescript, so it's easier to work with.
2. Modularize the code, so it's easier to add new inputs.
3. Drive simulation inputs from an event bus.
4. Connect a music FFT to the event bus, so we can visualize musics!
